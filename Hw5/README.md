<li> Use the recorded EEG data in a motor imagery experiment to train models.
<li> There are six classes of motor imagery class in our dataset, including left/right-hand movement, left/right leg movement, tongue movement and passive imagery.
<li> Predict motor imagery class based on the given EEG data.
<li> Use RNN-based and CNN-based models to model time series data and compare the different performance between them.
